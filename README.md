# InuaDada-Foundation
A Foundation envisions on global community that empowers, upholds the dignity and protects the rights of every girl child and extends that to her caregivers and community.
Our story began on August 26th 2013, with an emotive feature titled “Period of Shame” on Citizen TV, which caught the attention of many people, our founder, Janet Mbugua, included. 
# InuaDada-Foundation Android Application

## Technologies used
