# InuaDada-Foundation
A Foundation envisions on global community that empowers, upholds the dignity and protects the rights of every girl child and extends that to her caregivers and community.
Our story began on August 26th 2013, with an emotive feature titled “Period of Shame” on Citizen TV, which caught the attention of many people, our founder, Janet Mbugua, included. 
# InuaDada-Foundation Android Application
Based on the Foundation above by Janet Mbugua. I have developed an android appplication that can easily be used and has as much features as the website platform being used.
